## Kane Gin

I am an enthusiastic Junior Full Stack Web Developer excited about learning new skills. I am looking for a role where I can build upon my 
existing programming knowledge as well as gain exposure in business and finance.

I am currently working my way through the Makers Academy developer bootcamp having graduated from Durham University with first class honours
in chemistry. Since then I have become a CSIA level 2 qualified ski instructor as well as beginning to teaching myself how to code in python.

## Experience

**Sanddown ski centre** (Jan 2020 to June 2020)  
_Ski instructor_

- Daily responsibilities involved teaching lessons ranging from large school groups to one to one private lessons.

**Whistler Blackcomb Snow School, BC Canada** (Nov 2018 to May 2019)  
_Ski instructor_  
- Qualified CSIA level 2 ski instructor
- Daily responsibilities involved planning and teaching group lessons to both children and adults.
- Working as an instructor has help me develop the ability to tailoring my approach to teaching based upon the client's 
needs and ability as well as adapting my plans throughout the lesson based upon results. Additionally is has provided me 
with the opportunity to take on a leadership role which required effective communication with a variety of clients 
as well as take on the responsibility to ensure all participants were safe and satisfied.


## Skills

#### Adaptable

Whilst working as a ski instructor I would new clients daily who would require lessons tailored to their goals and ability level. Throughout
the day I would have to adapt my lesson plans based upon their progress and what I believed would best help them meet their goals.

#### Problem solver

Not only do I believe I am a strong problem solver but it is something I actively seek out to help develop new skills. When beginning to learn to
code one of my main resources was completing coding challenges online ([Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Kane9), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/d7450e47cbbb43d3e239705f23dca5dc8036883))
which helped me to develop logical processes to work through problems and create elegant solutions

#### Analytical thinker  

Throughout my time in higher education I have had a focus on analytical areas such as during my time studying chemistry. I would have weekly
lab sessions which once completed would require analysis on my results to understand what had happened during the experiments both theoretically
and in reality then draw conclusions from those ideas.

#### Excellent communicator

While teaching skiing the most important skill was being able to convey my ideas in an understandable way based upon the client. I learnt that
people learn in different ways and I have to adapt the way I communicate based upon who I am talking to. During this time I was exposed to a wide 
variety of clients with varying backgrounds and ages which has helped me develop these skills.
