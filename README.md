## Kane Gin

I am an ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer who values reliability and writing high quality, fully tested code. I am looking for a role which will allow me to continue to learn as well as provide me with opportunities to take on responsibility and progress within the company.

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, a coding bootcamp focussing on learning how to learn to prepare for an ever changing working environment. The driving force behind my decision to pursue a career in software development is that the industry is always developing meaning there are always opportunities to improve the way you work to solve problems. I find a satisfaction in learning how I can improve and implementing these new ideas into my work.

Prior to the bootcamp I graduated from Durham university with First-Class Honours in Chemistry highlighting my strong problem solving ability and analytical skill set. Additionally I worked as a ski instructor for two years in both Canada and England achieving my CSIA level 2 qualification.

## Experience

**Sanddown ski centre** (Jan 2020 to Aug 2020)

_Ski instructor_
*	Teaching private and group lessons for children or adults.
*	Strong communication skills to help clients understand how to improve
*	Adaptable teaching techniques to train clients based upon my interpretation of the clients’ ability and the goals.
* Leadership skills through taking responsibility for the safety and learning of my clients to help meet their goals.

**Whistler Blackcomb Snow School, BC Canada** (Nov 2018 to May 2019)

_Ski instructor_

* Qualified CSIA level 2 ski instructor
* Daily responsibilities involved planning and teaching group lessons to both children and adults.
* Working as an instructor has helped me to understand the different needs of clients and tailor my approach to teaching accordingly. Additionally, it has allowed me to take on a leadership role which required me to effectively communicate with a variety of clients as well as take responsibility for their safety.

## Skills
#### Adaptable
Whilst working as a ski instructor I would new clients daily who would require lessons tailored to their goals and ability level. Throughout the day I would have to adapt my lesson plans based upon their progress and what I believed would best help them meet their goals.

#### Problem solver
Not only do I believe I am a strong problem solver but it is something I actively seek out to help develop new skills. When beginning to learn to code one of my main resources was completing coding challenges online ([Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Kane9), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/d7450e47cbbb43d3e239705f23dca5dc8036883)) which helped me to develop logical processes to work through problems and create elegant solutions

#### Analytical thinker
Throughout my time in higher education I have had a focus on analytical areas such as during my time studying chemistry. I would have weekly lab sessions which once completed would require analysis on my results to understand what had happened during the experiments both theoretically and in reality then draw conclusions from those ideas.

#### Excellent communicator
While teaching skiing the most important skill was being able to clearly convey my ideas tailored to the client. I learnt that people learn in different ways and I have to adapt the way I communicate based upon who I am talking to. During this time I was exposed to a diverse range of clients with varying backgrounds and ages which has helped me develop these skills.

## Education

### Makers Academy (March 2021 to June 2021)

* Top rated UK bootcamp over 16 weeks with a 10% acceptance rate
* Implementing practices such as self-led learning, growth mindset, team feedback, pair programming, TDD and agile working

**Skills**
* OOP, TDD, MVC
* Agile/XP
* Ruby, JavaScript
* Rails, Sinatra, MERN stack
* RSpec, Jasmine
* Git
* HTML, CSS

### Durham University, Chemistry, First class honours (October 2015 to June 2018)

* Highly analytical with weekly lab projects which required analysis based on our results.
* Good time management as two days a week were spent in labs meaning I had to effectively manage my remaining time to keep up with theory as well as extra-curricular activities. 


### Whitgift School (September 2008 to June 2015)

_Academic scholar_
#### A Levels
Mathematics (A*), Further Mathematics (A*), Chemistry (A*), Physics (A)

#### GCSEs
8 A* including Maths, German and English, 2 As and an A in Further Maths (FSMQ).

## Hobbies

I am a member of my local hockey club which I play at every week and of course a keen skier, I’ll take any opportunity to get out onto the snow. I also enjoy completing coding challenges on websites such as CodeWars which was one of the main ways I got into coding to begin with.
